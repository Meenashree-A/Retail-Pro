Retail Pro: Integrated Inventory, Billing, and E-Commerce System
The Retail Pro system is a comprehensive shopping website designed to facilitate a smooth e-commerce experience for users. The initial landing page, or Menu page, provides easy navigation with hyperlinks to the main shopping site and essential user management options, including "Add User," "Update User," "Search User," "Delete User," and "Logout." Each function is fully integrated with a MySQL database, ensuring efficient management of user data.

Upon entering the shopping section, users can select their preferred mobile type—either Apple or Android. Each category has its own dedicated page, designed similarly to well-known e-commerce sites like Amazon and Flipkart. These pages feature options to "Add to Cart," view item costs, and select quantities, providing users with a streamlined shopping experience.

The final stage of the process is the Payment page. Here, an ID is generated based on the user’s transaction, which is then fetched from the database during the billing process. Users proceed to payment using this ID, with the system displaying a confirmation message—"Payment Successful"—once the transaction is complete.
